I have done an app called "Evo11" for an UX design portfolio project, and thought it would be good to make it a fully interactive app.
This app helps you keep track of your transition journey.

so far includes the layout for:
- a random quote generator
- a morning routine checklist
- a photo gallery
- a long term checklist

to add:
- better CSS
- premade long term checklist (import JSON data?)
